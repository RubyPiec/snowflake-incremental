# Snowflake Incremental

A simple incremental game based around snowflakes.

## Currencies

- Snowflakes: The main currency, used for most upgrades!
- Snowballs: If you have enough snowflakes, you can condense them into a snowball!
- More to come...?

## Achievements

The game currently has 7 achievements, spanning from getting 25 snowflakes, to getting a million! This covers like... an hour of gameplay? I'm not quite sure how severe the timewalls in this game are.

## Upgrades

The game currently has 14 upgrades, of which 3 are repeatable, and 2 are purchased with snowballs.

## Idling

The game progresses without you (assuming you have upgrades that increase snowflakes per second), by default at 1/10th normal speed! The maximum time is capped to 1 week, which results in ~17 hours to 3.5 days worth of playtime, depending on the upgrades you have!
